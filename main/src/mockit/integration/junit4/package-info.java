/**
 * Provides integration with <em>JUnit 4.x</em> test runners, for version 4.5 or newer.
 * Contains the {@link mockit.integration.junit4.JMockit} custom test runner (which is not an actual test runner, but
 * just a way to ensure that JMockit gets properly initialized - a better way is to simply put <tt>jmockit-1.x.jar</tt>
 * <em>before</em> <tt>junit-4.x.jar</tt> in the test runtime classpath).
 * <p/>
 * This integration provides the following benefits to test code:
 * <ol>
 *    <li>
 *       Instance fields annotated with <tt>@Tested</tt>, <tt>@Injectable</tt>, <tt>@Mocked</tt>, or <tt>@Capturing</tt>
 *       are properly initialized.
 *    </li>
 *    <li>
 *       Test methods accept <em>mock parameters</em> (annotated with <tt>@Injectable</tt>, <tt>@Mocked</tt>, or
 *       <tt>@Capturing</tt>), whose values are mocked instances automatically created by JMockit and passed by the test
 *       runner when the test method is executed.
 *    </li>
 *    <li>
 *       Expected invocations specified through the Mocking API are automatically verified before the execution of a
 *       test is completed.
 *    </li>
 *    <li>
 *       Fake classes applied with the Faking API from inside a method annotated as a <tt>@Test</tt> or a
 *       <tt>@Before</tt> method are discarded right after the execution of the test method or the whole test,
 *       respectively. Similarly, fakes applied from a <tt>@BeforeClass</tt> method are discarded after all tests in a
 *       test class have executed.
 *    </li>
 * </ol>
